              outlets. Using a NodeJS server, calls to the API are handled with
              HTTP requests which are then sent to the client to be
              rendered/styled by react js and CSS/Material-UI. Those requests
              include; getting new articles, getting articles by category,
              getting articles based on search queries.

              Users are also allowed to save articles to a ClearDB database

              unauthorized users. Users register using token-based
              authentication provided by JWTs which is then saved to the browser
              using cookies. Once registered and saved into the ClearDB, users
              can save any article into their profile.

          <h5 class="project-whys--subheader">--Why did i build it?</h5>
          <p>
            Right before the inception of this site (which would have been
            around October 2020), there was uncertainty about the future. What
            will life be like after a pandemic? When can we expect a vaccine?
            What will the job outlook be like? Are the NY Giants finally going
            to make the playoffs? All important questions about the future. As a
            way to keep up with current events, I wanted to keep some tab on
            national news. However, I didn't want to get my information from one
            or two news sources nor, did I want to sift through several news
            outlets. Why? Because I'm lazy. That left news aggregators like
            Google News or AllTop. However, I didn't like the UI from either
            site. I felt there was a little too much going on onscreen, which
            gave off this feeling of being "cramped." So now I had issues with
            both single news outlets and news aggregators. Thus, the idea of
            "hey, maybe I should build my news aggregator" was born! One that
            had the styles similar to apnews.com but grabbed from various news
            sites similar to what Google News does.
          </p>
          <p>
            However!.... I needed a name. It "needed" to give off a feeling like
            your reading a newspaper. You know, the one that people might get at
            the local grocery store once a week. I also want it to give off the
            same feeling as an older newspaper. The ones where newspaper boys
            would hold while yelling "Extra!, Extra!, Read all about it!" Why?
            No reason. I just wanted to give it a feeling of old newspapers
            turning modern. Wait! "Week," "Extra"....."ExtraWeeklyNews?" No,
            that doesn't roll off the tongue. Hmmmmm..... Week?, Extra?,
            "TheWeeklyExtra"..... Perfect.
          </p>
          <!-- <h5 class="project-whys--subheader">--Why ReactJS/NodeJS?</h5>
          <p>
            Seeing how this app will call an api and allow user authentication,
            using server-side code was at the time was the most logical way of
            going forward.

                Initial page load is still pretty slow. This is likely due to
                heroku's dynos sleeping

            <li>

                Cannot generate JWT refresh tokens, forcing users to login again
                after a day. This sounds like it would lead to terrible UX and
                security issues
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Realtionship between user and saved article should be changd to
                avoid duplications in MySQL. Two users can save the same article
                and that article would appear twice in the SQL table. That's
                probably not a good thing

            <li>
              <p>
                Lack of loading animations or spinners sites doesn't give me the
                same UX I get when I'm on other news sites. When the page is
                loading, how do I know if the articles are actually getting
                rendered? Better feedback could improve experience for users
                with slower internet
